[narrator]: Once upon a time, there once was a sandwich named Mr. Salami Sandwich. He was made from two pieces of sourdough bread and had salami in the middle of his body.
[mss]: I am not feeling well today. My salami insides have a fever and I cannot get rid of this cough. I should go get a COVID-19 test from the store.
[femamle1]: Hi there. Our COVID-19 tests are in the back.
[mss]: Thanks.
[narrator]: Mr. Salami Sandwich went home and took the test. He was shocked to see it was positive.
[mss]: Oh man. I have Coronavirus. What should I do?
