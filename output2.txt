[narrator]: "Once upon a time, there once was a sandwich named Mr. Salami Sandwich. He was made from two pieces of sourdough bread and genoa salami in the middle of his body. He preferred to have a little mustard inside himself each morning. He had big round eyes and little stick arms and legs. He lived in a world with humans and was the only living sandwich. He knew his name, but did not know where he came from. Mr. Salami Sandwich loved to go on adventures."
[narrator]: "One day, Mr. Salami Sandwich woke up and it was Christmas."
[mss]: "I am so excited to open presents!"
[wife]: "Oh honey. You are a sandwich and your kids are human."
[son]: "Dad! We get to open the presents, not you. Silly sandwich"
[mss]: "Oh son. I forgot. Did you get me a present?"
---
[son]: "Oh yeah. I got you a present."
[mss]: "I love presents! Gimme!"
[son]: "That was for me and my sister, not you."
[mss]: "Oh son. I'm sorry. I forgot again."
[wife]: "It's ok honey. You are a sandwich and your kids are human. You forget a lot of things."
[mss]: "I think I'll go on an adventure."
