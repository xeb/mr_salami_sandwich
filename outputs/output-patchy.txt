[narrator]: Once upon a time, there once was a sandwich named Mr. Salami Sandwich. He was made from two pieces of sourdough bread and had salami in the middle of his body.
[mss]: I have a new idea. I am going to create a land full of rides and toys. I will call it Lego Land.
[narrator]: So he spent the next 4 years creating Lego Land. 
[mss]: Today is the grand opening of Lego Land. Are we ready?
[female1]: Yes, sir. Mr. Sandwich! Open the gates.
[mss]: Very good.
[female2]: Let's go!
[mss]: I am so excited.
[narrator]: Mr. Sandwich was so excited that he forgot to check if the rides were safe.
[mss]: I think we should have a ride that goes really fast.
[narrator]: So he created a roller coaster that went really fast.
[mss]: This is going to be the best day ever!
[narrator]: The next morning, Mr. Sandwich woke up and went to the bathroom. He looked in the mirror and saw that he was covered with cuts, bruises, and bandages.
[mss]: What happened? I am all beat up.
[narrator]: So Mr. Sandwich called his friend Patchy Paul to help him figure out what had happened.
[mss]: Patchy Paul, can you help me? I don't know what happened to me last night.
[pa]: Sure, Mr. Sandwich. I will go back in time and see what happened to you last night.
[mss]: Thank you, Patchy Paul.
[pa]: I am going back in time now.
[mss]: I hope you find out what happened to me last night.
[pa]: I found out what happened to you last night. You went to Lego Land and forgot to check if the rides were safe. You went on the "Extreme Ride" and it crashed into a bunch of trees and you got hurt really bad.
[mss]: That is terrible! I am going to make sure that all of my rides are safe. I am going to make sure that nothing bad happens here again!
[pa]: That is a good idea, Mr. Sandwich! You should also make sure that you check if the rides are safe before you go on them!
[mss]: You are right, Patchy Paul! I will make sure that I check if the rides are safe before I go on them!
[pa]: I am going back in time now.
[mss]: Thank you, Patchy Paul.
[pa]: I am going back in time now.
[mss]: I hope you find out what happened to me last night.

[pa]: It is time for me to go now.
[mss]: Thank you for visiting me, Patchy Paul!
[pa]: And thank you for watching me, Mr. Sandwich!
[mss]: Good-bye, Patchy Paul.
