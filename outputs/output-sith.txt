[narrator]: This is a tale about how the Sith were formed. Over six thousand years ago in a galaxy far, far away, there lived a man named Thrax. He was a quiet hard working farmer. One day Thrax was attacked by bandits and he summoned the Dark Side of the Force to use lightning powers on the bandits. After returning home, he woke up the next day.
[Thrax]: I must learn more about my powers. I will go speak to the Jedi in the next village.
[narratir]: So he set off. As soon as he areived at the village with the Jedi, he was shocked at what he saw.
[Thrax]: What is that?
[Jedi]: It is a droid. We use it to help us with our work. You can ask it and it will answer any question you have.
[Thrax]: Wow, I've never seen anything like this before. May I touch it?
[Jedi]: Yes but be careful, if you press the red button, the droid will attack anyone who comes near you.
[narrator]: So he touched the red button and suddenly the droid attacked him! The Jedi managed to stop it from attacking Thrax but he was very angry at the Jedi for not warning him about what would happen if he pressed the red button. He left without speaking to them. 
[Thrax] : They are no better than those bandits that attacked me yesterday! They must be destroyed! I will go to Coruscant and speak with Chancellor Palpatine about this matter! 
[narrator] : So he set off for Coruscant and when he arrived there, he saw Darth Sidious (who was Chancellor Palpatine) talking with Yoda and Mace Windu, two other powerful Jedi Masters. They were discussing how they should destroy all of the Sith who lived on Korriban because they had become too powerful for their liking. 
[Yoda:] We must destroy them all or else they will destroy us all! 
[Mace Windu:] That's right! We cannot let them get away with doing what they did to us in the past! 
[Darth Sidious:] I agree with you both but how do we do it? There are many of these Sith Lords and only two of us here now so we cannot defeat them alone. Do any of you have any ideas? 
[Yoda:] We could contact our friends on Coruscant and tell them to send some troops here as soon as possible so we can defeat these Sith once and for all! 
[Mace Windu:] That is an excellent idea Yoda! Let's do it now! 
[narrator] : So they contacted their friends on Coruscant immediately and told them what had happened and asked them if they could send some troops over as soon as possible so that they could defeat these Sith once and for all. A few days later, a large fleet arrived on Korriban ready for battle against these Sith Lords who had been causing trouble throughout the galaxy for thousands of years already by then... And so began one of the biggest battles ever in galactic history...
[Darth Sidious:] Well done my apprentice you have done well in helping me conquer this planet... Now let us return back home... 
[Mace Windu:] Wait Master Sidious! Something doesn't feel right about letting this man live... Did anyone check his pulse after defeating him? Perhaps we should make sure he is dead before leaving this place... After all we don't want another Dark Lord rising up again anytime soon... What do you think Yoda? 
[Yoda:] You are right my friend, let's make sure he is dead first before returning back home...
