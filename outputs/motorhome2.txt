[man1]: Wonderful! Please be careful and have a great time, Mr. Salami Sandwich!
[mss]: Thank you. Goodbye now! Bye!
[narrator]: And so, Mr. Salami Sandwich went on his journey across the country to see his uncle in California. He took many stops along the way because he loved stopping at diners for breakfast and hamburgers for lunch and dinner. At each diner, restaurant or truck stop that he stopped at, he always ordered a cheeseburger with bacon between two pieces of sourdough bread. At every meal, Mr. Salami Sandwich could not wait to eat them since they were his favorite sandwiches of all time! It was almost sundown when he arrived at his Uncle Cheeseburger's house in San Diego one day after noon eating a delicious cheeseburger with bacon between two pieces of sourdough bread. When they saw each other, they were happy and thrilled that they were finally together again!
[Uncle Cheeseburger] : Oh my goodness it is so wonderful to see you again after all these years, Mr. Salami Sandwich!!
[mss]: I am glad we are together again too Uncle Cheeseburger! Just think... if it weren't for this sandwich right here.. we would never have seen each other ever again!!!
[Uncle Cheeseburger] : I know, isn't it incredible?! Thank you Mr. Salami Sandwich for bringing us together again!
[mss]: It is my pleasure Uncle Cheeseburger. I love you very much!
[Uncle Cheeseburger] : I love you too, Mr. Salami Sandwich! You are the best!
[mss]: Now what should we eat?
[Uncle Cheeseburger] : How about a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and tomato on sourdough bread?
[mss]: That sounds great to me!!! Let's get started making it right now!!
