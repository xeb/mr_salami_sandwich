[narrator]: There once was an old man who lived alone in a condo in New York City. His apartment was filled with ancient books and obscure trinkets. The old man was named David and spent decades trying to unlock the secrets of magic.
[david]: I think I have discovered how to freeze time. I must use the ancient spell in this book.
[narrator]: So David went to his study and began his enchantment. Just then there was a knock at the door.
[jen]: David! It is you! I have been trying to find you for days. It's me Jen. I am the manager of the building. You owe me to rent. Where have you been?
[david]: Uh… I have been studying magic.
[jen]: Oh yeah? Well, you better fix the elevator or you will be paying for it!
[narrator]: David was furious but calmed himself and began the enchantment again. Just then there was another knock at the door.
[brian]: Hey dude! What's up? It's Brian your buddy from college.
[david]: Not now. I am trying to cast a spell to freeze time.
[brian]: Oh cool! I just quit my job and need some cash so can I borrow $1000?
[david]: No! Now leave me alone!
[narrator]: David tried once more but it was no use. Again someone interrupted him before he could finish his spell. The next day David went to the bank and withdrew $20000 in cash he kept in a safe deposit box, brought it home and buried it under his bed where no one would ever find it. Then he began his enchantment once again, but this time he would not be disturbed by anyone or anything, not even himself. He worked for days until finally he had finished all of the steps of the ancient spell right down to chanting out loud: "The world shall stop!" But just as he finished uttering those words, there came a knock at the door.
[jen] Hey David!? You better open up! It's me Jen from downstairs again.. You owe me rent money!! 
[David] Get out of here! Leave me alone! 
[Jen] Get off your lazy ass and pay me the rent money or else!! 
[David] Fine, I'll get you your money tomorrow… Now go away!!! 
[Jen]
[ David ] Daveedddyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!
