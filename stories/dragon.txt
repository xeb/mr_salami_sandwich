Narrator: "Once upon a time, there once was a sandwich named Mr. Salami Sandwich. He was made from two pieces of sourdough bread and genoa salami in the middle of his body. He preferred to have a little mustard inside himself each morning. He had big round eyes and little stick arms and legs. He lived in a world with humans and was the only living sandwich. He knew his name, but did not know where he came from. Mr. Salami Sandwich loved to go on adventures."
Narrator: "One day, Mr. Salami Sandwich discovered a portal to another dimension full of salami sandwiches."
mss: "Wow! There are so sandwiches here. What's your name?"
Cletus: "I am Cletus. I am a Ruben sandwich. What's your name?"

mss: "I am Mr. Salami Sandwich. I am the only living sandwich in our world. Do you know where salami sandwich came from?"
Cletus: "No. I just know I was born with a taste for salami. I do not know why I love the taste of salami."
mss: "I am looking for the salami sandwich maker. I would like to know where I came from."
Cletus: "I do not know where you came from, but I know where the salami sandwich maker is."
Narrator: "Cletus led Mr. Salami Sandwich to a little cottage at the end of the road. It was the salami sandwich maker's home."
Mr. Salami Sandwich Maker: "Hello. Can I help you?"
mss: "Hi. Are you Mr. Salami Sandwich Maker?"
Mr. Salami Sandwich Maker: "Yes. I am. But what are you here for?"
mss: "Where did I come from?"

Mr. Salami Sandwich Maker: "You were made in a laboratory by a mad scientist named Dr. Salami Sandwich. He was the only one who knew how to make salami sandwiches. I learned how to make them from him. I am glad I did, but I miss him."
mss: "Where is he?"
Mr. Salami Sandwich Maker: "He died."
mss: "Oh, I am sorry to hear that."
Mr. Salami Sandwich Maker: "Do you want me to make you?"
mss: "Yes!"
Mr. Salami Sandwich Maker: "Let me just put the mustard in."
mss: "I like mustard."
Mr. Salami Sandwich Maker: "There. Now you are ready to go on your first adventure."
mss: "Thanks! I will see you later."
