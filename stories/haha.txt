[narrator]: "Once upon a time, there once was a sandwich named Mr. Salami Sandwich. He was made from two pieces of sourdough bread and genoa salami in the middle of his body. He preferred to have a little mustard inside himself each morning. He had big round eyes and little stick arms and legs. He lived in a world with humans and was the only living sandwich. He knew his name, but did not know where he came from. Mr. Salami Sandwich loved to go on adventures."
[narrator]: "One day, Mr. Salami Sandwich woke up and it was Christmas."
[mss]: "I am so excited to open presents!"
[wife]: "Oh honey. You are a sandwich and your kids are human."
[son]: "Dad! We get to open the presents, not you. Silly sandwich"
[mss]: "Oh son. I forgot. Dis you get me a present?"
---
[son]: "Of course I did! I got you a whole bunch of presents! One of them is a tiny elf that lives in a miniature house."
[mss]: "Oh son. You are so wonderful to me. Thank you. Now, let's open the rest of the presents!"
[wife]: "Here honey, I got you a present."
[son]: "I got you a present too!"
[mss]: "Thank you wife and son! This is the best Christmas ever!"
[wife]: "Hey sandwich, I think we gave you an elf as well"
[mss]: "That's strange. I just opened an elf from my son and it seems familiar?"
[son]: "You had a present from us? That's strange. Dad, where did you get this elf?"
[mss]: "That's weird. It feels like it came from inside of me but I don't know where it could be in my body."
[wife]: "Are you okay sandwich?"
[mss]: "I'm not sure. My stomach feels very tight and bloated." [stomach rumbles]
[son]: "Dad, your stomach just growled really loud."
[mss]: "It must have been something I ate last night. I think I will go to sleep now."
[wife]: "Okay honey. Sweet dreams"
[narrator]: "Mr. Salami Sandwich went to bed and started to drift off to sleep. He wasn't sure if he was dreaming or not but he saw himself inside of a warm soft bun with some marinara sauce on top of him. He felt calm and safe inside of this bread. In his dream he felt like he was part of something bigger than himself and he was happy."
[narrator]: "The next morning Mr. Salami Sandwich woke up and remembered his dream the night before. He felt happy that he might have been able to finally feel like he belonged somewhere." [stomach rumbles]
"Oh no! Here comes another stomach growl!" [rumbling sound] [stomach continues to rumble]
[mss]: "What on earth sweet sandwich?!"
[mss]: "I am so hungry right now, but I can't go to breakfast until everyone else does." [stomach rumbles] [sighs]
"I guess the only thing left for me to do is eat some marinara sauce out of the jar." [stomach rumbles] [crunching sounds] [this goes on for about 5 minutes] Â "Wait a minute... What is happening inside of me?!" [crunching sounds continue] (note: at this point it should be clear what is going on)
