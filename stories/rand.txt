Narrator: "Once upon a time, there once was a sandwich named Mr. Salami Sandwich. He was made from two pieces of sourdough bread and genoa salami in the middle of his body. He preferred to have a little mustard inside himself each morning. He had big round eyes and little stick arms and legs. He lived in a world with humans and was the only living sandwich. He knew his name, but did not know where he came from. Mr. Salami Sandwich loved to go on adventures."
Narrator: "One day, Mr. Salami Sandwich discovered a poetal to another dimension full of salami sandwiches."
mss: "Wow! There are so sandwiches here. What's your name?"
Cletus: "I am Cletus. I am a Ruben sandwich. What's your name?"
