[narrator]: "Once upon a time, there once was a sandwich named Mr. Salami Sandwich. He was made from two pieces of sourdough bread and genoa salami in the middle of his body. He preferred to have a little mustard inside himself each morning. He had big round eyes and little stick arms and legs. He lived in a world with humans and was the only living sandwich. He knew his name, but did not know where he came from. Mr. Salami Sandwich loved to go on adventures."
[narrator]: "One day, Mr. Salami Sandwich decided to visit New York City. Being primairly made of meat, he knew the Big Apple was the place to be if he was ever going to meet any other sandwich people."
[narrator]: "On a Tuesday morning, he decided to set out."
[mss]: "Here I go! I cannot wait to ride the subway today. It's going to be so much fun, I can barely contain myself. I'm leaking mustard!"
[narrator]: "Mr. Salami Sandwich took a cab to the train station."
[mss]: "One ticket to New York City, please!"
[tkt]: "What the!?!? Are you? Are you? A...a... sandwich?"
[mss]: "Yes, I am! Nice to meet you!"
[tkt]: "Same, Mr. Sandwich. So one ticket to New York then?"
