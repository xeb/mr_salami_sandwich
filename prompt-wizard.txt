[narrator]: There once was an old man who lived alone in a condo in New York City. His apartment was filled with ancient books and obscure trinkets. The old man was named David and spent decades trying to unlock the secrets of magic.
[david]: I think I have discovered how to freeze time. I must use the ancient spell in this book.
[narrator]: So David went to his study and began his enchantment. Just then there was a knock at the door.
[jen]: David! It is you! I have been trying to find you for days. It's me Jen. I am the manager of the building. You owe me to rent. Where have you been?
