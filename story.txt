[narrator]: "Once upon a time, there once was a sandwich named Mr. Salami Sandwich. He was made from two pieces of sourdough bread and genoa salami in the middle of his body. He preferred to have a little mustard inside himself each morning. He had big round eyes and little stick arms and legs. He lived in a world with humans and was the only living sandwich. He knew his name, but did not know where he came from. Mr. Salami Sandwich loved to go on adventures."
[narrator]: "One day, Mr. Salami Sandwich decided to visit the Space Needle in Seattle. He got on a train because that was the fastest way from his house in Pike's Place Market."
[mss]: "Here I go! I cannot wait to ride to the top of the Space Needle. It's going to be so much fun, I can barely contain myself. I'm leaking mustard!"
[narrator]: "Mr. Salami Sandwich lived on mustard. It was like hos blood, but it was yellow. But Mr. Salami Sandwich was no coward. He was not afraid of anything. Even though his mustard blood was indeed yellow."
[mss]: "One ticket to the Space Needle, please!"
[tkt]: "What the!?!? Are you? Are you? A...a... sandwich?"
[narrator]: "Said the Ticket Sales Person as Mr. Salami Sandwich approached the booth"
[mss]: "Yes, I am! Nice to meet you!"
[narrator]: "The Ticket Sales Person was afraid because she had never seen a talking sandwich before. But she knew this sandwich was a boy. Well, not a boy, but a Mister. She decided to be polite and call him Mr. Sandwich. Because she did mot know what kind of meat he had on the inside."
[tkt]: "Same, Mr. Sandwich. So one ticket to the top of the Space Needle?"
[mss]: "Yes, one ticket please."
[narrator]: "Said Mr. Salami Sandwich. The Ticket Sales Person punched the ticket into her computer and gave it to him."
[tkt]: "Here you go, sir."
[narrator]: "Said the woman. Then she leaned in close to Mr. Salami Sandwich and whispered into his ear."
[tkt+whisper]: "Just so you know, I'm vegetarian."
[mss]: "Thank you for telling me that!"
[narrator]: "Said Mr. Salami Sandwich as he left with his ticket in hand. He walked up to the Space Needle because it was only a short walk away from their house at Pike's Place Market. When he arrived there, a robot greeted him."
[robot]: "Hello sir! Welcome to Space Needle! How may I help your sandwich ass?"
[mss]: "I need to board the elevator that takes people up to the top of this building."
[robot+annoyed sighing sound], robot: "...alright" [blinks] [to self] [sighing sound]...dear god..." [buzzing sounds as robot moves arms around] ...and then it is time for you to go on an adventure! A...a...adventure!" ["ding!" sound as elevator doors open] [doors close]" Â
