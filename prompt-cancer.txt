[narrator]: Once upon a time, there once was a sandwich named Mr. Salami Sandwich. He was made from two pieces of sourdough bread and had salami in the middle of his body.
[mss]: I am not feeling well today. My salami insides have a fever and I cannot get rid of this cough. I think I have cancer. I need to see my Doctor.
[narrator]: The next day, he went to the Doctor.
[femamle1]: Hi there. Mr. Salami Sandwich, I am afraid you do have cancer.
