[narrator]: "Once upon a time, there once was a sandwich named Mr. Salami Sandwich. He was made from two pieces of sourdough bread and had salami in the middle of his body."
[narrator]: "He preferred to have a little mustard in his body. Mustard was like blood for sandwich people."
[narrator]: "Mr. Salami Sandwich had big round eyes and little stick arms and legs. He lived in a world with humans and was the only living sandwich." 
[narrator]: "He knew his name, but did not know where he came from. Mr. Salami Sandwich loved to go on adventures."
[narrator]: "One day, Mr. Salami Sandwich booked a trip to the North Pole."
[mss]: "I am so excited to go to the North Pole! This is going to be the best adventure ever"
[narrator]: "Said Mr. Salami Sandwich, to no one in particular."
[narrator]: "He then went to the airport to buy a ticket. He packed his bags and took a taxi."
[mss]: "One ticket to the North Pole, please."
[tkt]: "Ok. We don't have special seats for sandwiches, is that OK?"
[narrator]: "Said the Ticket Sales Person"
[mss]: "Yes, that's ok. I am used to being the only sandwich in a human world. How long will the trip take?"
[tkt]: "About six hours. We have super fast planes."
[narrator]: "The trip took 27 hours. The Ticket Sales Person was very wrong. Mr. Salami Sandwich was annoyed. But they finally landed in the North Pole!"
[mss]: "I am going to find Santa now!"
[narrator]: "Mr. Salami Sandwich did not know how to get to Santa now that he was at the North Pole."
[mss]: "Excuse me, ma'am. Can you help me find out where I can rent a sleigh?"
[woman]: "Are you a sandwich? That is so weird. But I can rent you a dog sled. Do you want it?"
[mss]: "Yes please! How about for $10?"
[woman]: "Ok. That works."
