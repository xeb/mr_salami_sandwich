[narrator]: This is a tale about how the Sith were formed. Over six thousand years ago in a galaxy far, far away, there lived a man named Thrax. He was a quiet hard working farmer. One day Thrax was attacked by bandits and he summoned the Dark Side of the Force to use lightning powers on the bandits. After returning home, he woke up the next day.
[Thrax]: I must learn more about my powers. I will go speak to the Jedi in the next village.
[narrator]: So he set off. As soon as he areived at the village with the Jedi, he was shocked at what he saw.
